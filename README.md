A lot of our program came to being whilst brainstorming and drowning in our sorrows on a whiteboard. Before we started coding in the terminal we researched the list, iomanip and string libraries to get a deeper understanding of the project and our goal.
You run the program by choosing any of the 8 options listed in the menu:

Option 1:
  Reads information out of the .txt File matchig the provided Filename from the User.
Option 2:
  Creates a File and prints the current Book structures within the Library to it.
Option 3:
  Prints all Book structures within the Library to the console.
Option 4:
  Filters the Library and reveals any information on the provided Book title.
Option 5:
  Filters through the Library and reveals any data connected to the provided Author.
Option 6:
  Adds and Sorts a Book structure into the Library according to the user's inputs.
Option 7:
  Deletes the book structure with a matching Author and Title
Option 8:
  Quits the Program

The overall creation of the project was done by both partners with the base functions and files mostly being the work of Justin Finn. The comments and any string manipulation being the work of Gabriel Speer. Both Partners also contributed to an intense amount of debugging throughout the project.
